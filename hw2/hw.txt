2. First 12 coordinates popped off the stack by the algorithm: 
	1. 3, 5
	2. 3, 6
	3. 3, 4
	4. 2, 4	
	5. 1, 4
	6. 1, 3
	7. 1, 2
	8. 1, 1
	9. 2, 1
	10. 3, 3
	11. 4, 5
	12. 5, 5

4. First 12 coordinates popped off the queue by the algorithm: 
	1. 3, 5
	2. 4, 5
	3. 3, 4
	4. 3, 6
	5. 5, 5
	6. 3, 3
	7. 2, 4
	8. 6, 5
	9. 5, 4
	10. 1, 4
	11. 7, 5
	12. 5, 3

The two algorithms differ because a queue is used in #3 whereas a stack is used in #1. This means that when the stack/queue is popped, the coordinates are popped in a different order. A stack’s pop function will pop the most recent item off the stack, in a LIFO scheme. whereas a queue’s pop function will pop the front item in the queue (the one added first) off the queue, in a FIFO scheme. Therefore, the coordinates are popped off in a different order.
